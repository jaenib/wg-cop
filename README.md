## intro

Telegram Bot to track rommate social credit score and, if prompted, exercise microauthority. 



<br>You can track expenses that involve a subset of all household members while the bot is keeping the books.

There is a chore system: it's not by specific chore but minutes spent doing anything that is agreed to be a credible chore. Each 15 mins gets 1 Point.

Penalties are spoken when a member is trailing more than 4 points behind the leader, for more than one week. The bot keeps track of penalties too and notifies the 

household group chat every monday.




<br>The bot sends an "I'm alive" message every four hours to confirm it is running to the "bothandler user id" specified in config.py.
